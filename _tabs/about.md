I hail from a quaint little town in West Bengal, India, called Tamluk. Growing up, I was blessed with a wonderful family comprising of my parents and a doting elder brother.

As an individual, I have always been fascinated by novel discoveries and enjoy exploring diverse fields of study, be it mathematics, magic, psychology, painting, and everything in between. In my free time, I also indulge in video editing and am keenly learning the art of Stock Market Investing, constantly on the lookout for new techniques to enhance my skills.
