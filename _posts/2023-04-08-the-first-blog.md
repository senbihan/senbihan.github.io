## Introduction

Greetings, fellow readers! I am thrilled to make my debut on this platform with a blog series that has been simmering in my mind for quite some time. But first, allow me to introduce myself. I'm a computer science enthusiast who has been tinkering with codes and algorithms since my high school days. You can learn more [about me here.](/about)

And now, as I approach my 28th year, I feel the need to document my learning journey, one step at a time.

## The Plan

I believe in plans, even though I have a reputation for being impulsive at times. Hence, I have chalked out a rough roadmap that I hope to follow for the next year or so. Here are my plans, and I hope you're as excited as I am:

* To begin with, I have dabbled in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI systems through my coursework. Though I don't use them in my day job, I'm fascinated by the research and development that's happening in these fields. Therefore, I aim to study and document everything that piques my curiosity, in my unique style.

* Moreover, I'm keen on conducting random yet enjoyable experiments with ML or distributed systems. My plan is to make these experiments open source on GitHub and provide a detailed analysis on this platform.

* Apart from this, I intend to explore niche areas that I have been interested in since my college days, such as Game Theory, Economics, and Finance. I'm excited to delve deeper into these topics and share my insights with you.

* And lastly, to add a personal touch to this blog, I will share snippets from my life - be it travel pictures, events, or any other amusing anecdotes that come my way.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I'm thrilled to start this blog series and share my learning journey with all of you. I firmly believe that documenting our experiences and insights is crucial for personal growth and development. It helps us reflect on our progress, identify areas for improvement, and share knowledge with others.

I want to emphasize that this is a collaborative effort, and I welcome your comments, feedback, and suggestions. Let's learn and grow together!
